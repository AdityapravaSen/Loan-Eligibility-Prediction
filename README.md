# Loan Eligibility Prediction
---
This project is an End-to-End Data Science project which predicts whether a person is eligible for loan base on the given dataset.
The dataset has been taken from [Kaggle- Loan Eligibility Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vikasukani/loan-eligible-dataset)

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Description
Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. Customer-first applies for a home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for a loan.

The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling the online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customer's segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here]() within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...
